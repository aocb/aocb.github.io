Welcome to my portfolio!
I'm in my senior year of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.

This project is my website to showcase my personal and professional projects. This is my first experience with GitHub so things might get hairy...

I am passionate about cars and motorsports. If you are looking for a highly motivated and skilled mechanical engineer with tire manufacturing experience, please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.
