Welcome to my mechanical engineering portfolio!
I'm in my third year of studies at Queen's University. I have a passion for automotive engineering and motorsports.

This project is my website to showcase my personal and professional projects. This is my first experience with GitHub, so please inform me on how to improve my code!

I am currently looking for a summer internship! Please contact me at:
